## Design Choices
Some of what we implemented could have just been usages of libraries, but I wanted to try writing (almost) everything from scratch. For example, we could have used a library to determine whether hero or villain won the poker hand, but it is an interesting problem that I wanted to try finding my own solution.

To use the makefile, type "make" and then run ./test
